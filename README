This application is useless without having the appropriate databases set up. For more information
about this, and various databases communicate directly with me, or have a look around in some
appropriate places (see end of this).

To install:

Check the documentation found at:
http://www.cdb.riken.jp/scb/documentation.html

Since that might not be up to date, or since it might have disappeared,
here is a short description of the process and requirements.

1. Make sure to have the Qt (version 3) development libraries installed.

2. Make sure to have Postgresql installed along with the old C++ interface called libpq++.

3. Have some idea as to where the above two are located.

4. Make a Makefile using the qmake command..

> qmake -o Makefile mtserver.pro

5. Edit the Makefile to make it useful. You'll need to :
	a. Add 
		-DHAVE_NAMESPACE_STD -DHAVE_CXX_STRING_HEADER -DDLLIMPORT=""
	to the end of the CXXFLAGS = line. (This is something to do with the
	libpq++ libraries, and is something I don't really understand).
	b. Add
		-I/usrlocal/pgsql/include
	to the end of the INCPATH = line. Or change the above to where the include
	files have been installed. If postgresql has been installed using an rpm
	or other package management system, then the above path will be different.
	You may still need to add something like that, since you'll almost certainly
	have to install the libpq++ libraries yourself somewhere.
	c. Add 
		-L/usr/local/pgsql/lib
		-lpq++
	to the LIBS = line, in an appropriate manner. (See the 
	Makefile_with_pq_solving_thing for an example how to do this, or look
	at the old Makefile distributed with this source code before you
	run qmake.)

6. Run 'make', or possibly 'make clean' followed by 'make'.

7. Find some documentation as to what to do with the mtserver application.


*************************************************************************

Useful information. Currently there is some not completely up to date documentation at:

http://www.cdb.riken.jp/scb/documentation/index.html

but I rather suspect that will change with time. Hence to find out something more about the
system, google for 'eXintegrator' or to contact me, google for 'Martin Jakt'. Presently I can
be contacted on mjakt@cdb.riken.jp.

if you got this far.. good luck..
